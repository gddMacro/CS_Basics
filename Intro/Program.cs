// Create a RTS simulator using arrays, functions, loops, control-flow (NO CLASSES YET).
// Create at least 2 factions with units that are supposed to battle each other and to gather resources
// from each unit defeated. Also implement some simple selection logic to select # of units of your battalion.
// This unit is then entering the battle field. within the battle realm you have the opportunity to decide what
// units are screening the battle field for ressources and which are supposed to fight.
